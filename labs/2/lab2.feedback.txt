Neha,

About your programs...

Functionality

- One program functions correctly as required.

- Could not test functionality because one program cannot be compiled. Root cause
  seems to be the fact that the name of the file does not match the name of
  your class.  -2pts

ExtendedEuclidean.java:9: error: class ExtenEuclidean is public, should be declared in a file named ExtenEuclidean.java
public class ExtenEuclidean {

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- All programs are missing the header: -1pt
  /**
   * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
   * author: student name
   * course: CMPT 220
   * assignment: project 1
   * due date: August 30, 2003
   * version: 1.3
   * 
   * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
   * type.
   */

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.

Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
